My `.\*shrc`
=============

I'm using most of the time the zsh shell, but on few server where I can't 
install zsh (or where I do not feel the need to install it), I'm using what's 
available, most of the time bash.
This repository contains all my sh(es) configuration file (zsh, bash, ...).

Notes
=========

I've been a user of [oh-my-zsh][ohmyzsh] for few years now but I do agree with
[Vincent Bernat][vincentbernat] : 

> My Opinion is that you can't have an universal `.zshrc`.

That's why I'm currently ditching [oh-my-zsh][ohmyzsh] from my configuration.
Still it's a wonderful piece of software and a very active zsh community. There
is a lot of good ideas there, source of inspiration.
